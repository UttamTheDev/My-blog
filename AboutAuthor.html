                    <p class="para">My mission is to make learning web development as simple, engaging, and accessible as possible ‚Äî especially for students and freshers just starting their journey. I understand the challenges beginners face, so I strive to break down complex concepts into bite-sized, easy-to-follow lessons. Whether it's HTML, CSS, JavaScript, or backend technologies like PHP and MySQL, I focus on using real-world examples to help make learning easier and more intuitive. <br><br>

                    In this fast-evolving tech world, AI has played a pivotal role in my learning. With tools like AI-driven tutorials, code suggestions, and quick problem-solving, I‚Äôve been able to grasp new concepts at a faster pace. I aim to leverage the power of AI to not only accelerate my own learning but to also share these advancements with others, making the learning process both efficient and enjoyable. My goal is to create a supportive, AI-enhanced learning environment where beginners can build, experiment, and grow with confidence.</p>

                    <h2 class="mt-5" >üõ§Ô∏è My Journey</h2>
                    <p class="para">My journey started from college classrooms in Zoology, where I initially focused on the traditional path of securing a teaching job in high school. I spent countless hours studying textbooks, preparing for exams, and following a conventional route to build my career. But along the way, I discovered a new passion ‚Äî coding. What began as simple curiosity quickly turned into a deep interest.<br>

                      From late-night HTML practice in my hostel room to diving deeper into front-end development and web technologies, I found myself immersed in a world of creativity and problem-solving. Every day, I code, learn something new, or share useful insights with others. It‚Äôs been a journey of self-discovery, and now, what once seemed like a hobby has become my driving force and passion.</p>
